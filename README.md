# Useful React Components

A list of open-source react components/projects that are awesome.

### Images & Media

#### [React Image Gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery)

Simple image gallery with tons of options.

#### [React SVG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg)

Nice HOC to inline SVG that's available at a URL. Handles all your ajax and rendering for you! Great for inlining an SVG that is referenced via API response.

### Menus & Nav

#### [React Scrollspy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollspy)

A dead-simple component to add an 'active class' on menu items when their respective anchored section enters the viewport.
